My observations are:
User file not formatted
Districts data from Aras file also not formatted 

Assumptions 
1. Area data (District_1, district_1) is not case sensitive 
2. Same Beneficiary can visit same area or same service multiple times , it is not a duplicate data.


I would prefer visualization on Tableau.
